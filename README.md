# HighScoreApp

An application that I made to showcase high scores of a particular game in descending order, as usually shown in video games. This 
application is for academic purposes and I used it to demonstrate my ability of using HttpURLConnection to a PHP Script that uses MySQL to 
retrieve high scores from a localhost database and the Room database to store these retrieved high scores locally in the Android device. My
primary goal of successfully retrieving high scores from a database and being able to showcase them was accomplished. However, further
optimization in retrieving these scores is necessary as for a larger amount of data, it takes longer time to retrieve and set the scores
in the application and I will be working on that in the near future alongside future personal projects.

I have no intention of using this logo in any application which I monetize or sell.
